### Research 
I am a PhD student of Business Administration in the Strategy Department at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. I draw on strategic management theory, economic history, and empirical economics to study how firms and entrepreneurs:
- Adapt to shocks and exhibit resilience
- Adopt labor-automating technology
- Use experiments to build startups and raise capital

My broader aim is to discover strategy and policy that improve the efficacy of innovation and entrepreneurship.
