### Research 
I am a PhD student of Business Administration in the Strategy Department at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. I draw on strategic management, economic history, and empirical economics to study how firms:
- Adapt to shocks and exhibit resilience
- Adopt technology and automate labor
- Experiment to test new ventures and raise capital
My broader aim is to discover strategy that helps firms achieve greater performance in innovation and entrepreneurship.
