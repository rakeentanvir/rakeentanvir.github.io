I am a PhD student in Business Administration in the Strategy Department at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. My background spans economics, statistics, and psychology, and my research uses economic history, strategic management theory, and empirical economics to study how innovation and entrepreneurship can be made more effective. My projects explore:  
- How labor automation technologies are adopted and diffused among firms  
- How firms adapt and build resilience to shocks  
- How entrepreneurs and startups use experimentation under uncertainty to test their ventures and raise capital

My broader aim is to understand how firms navigate uncertainty, and how policy and strategy can structure that uncertainty into progress.
# Interests  
Alongside research, I experiment with systems for productivity and intentional living. To me, designing research and designing life systems are two sides of the same coin: both involve structuring complexity to uncover patterns and generate growth. 

I occasionally share reflections that blend academic research, personal transformation, and creative storytelling. My content often draws from fitness and bodybuilding, strategy, and South Asian cultural perspectives, with the goal of inspiring students, professionals, and academics to think more intentionally about growth.  
### Travel & Culture  
My family roots in Nepal and Bangladesh have shaped a lifelong curiosity about culture and perspective. I see travel as a way of reconnecting with history and identity rather than chasing a country count. Long, rambling walks in new places often spark my best research ideas.  
### Fitness & Discipline  
Bodybuilding and hypertrophy training are central to my daily life. I approach training with structure and measurement, treating physical growth as both discipline and narrative — a story of transformation, resilience, and progress.  
### Design & Systems  
I have a fascination with design in both research and life. This shows up in my work with structured datasets and historical archives, in the dashboards I build for productivity, and in my interest in architecture and aesthetics. I enjoy turning chaos into order and uncovering design patterns, whether in data, systems, or environments.  
### Content & Creativity  
I am developing a layered content practice that documents fitness, self-improvement, and research journeys through long-form writing, vlogs, and short-form media. This practice is as much about experimenting with storytelling as it is about sharing ideas — building bridges across academic, professional, and creative audiences.
