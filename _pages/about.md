I am a PhD student in Business Administration in the Strategy Department at Duke University’s Fuqua School of Business. My background spans economics, statistics, mathematics, and psychology. I draw on economic history, strategic management theory, and empirical economics to study how to make innovation and entrepreneurship more effective under uncertainty:
- How firms adopt and diffuse automation technologies, and interact with labor
- How businesses and workers adapt to shocks and build resilience
- How entrepreneurs design and use experiments to test startups and raise capital

My broader aim is to understand how firms and entrepreneurs navigate uncertainty, and how to transform it into opportunies for greater performance and progress through strategy and policy.

# Interests  
Outside of research, I explore systems for growth in life, fitness, and creative practice. I see designing research and structuring routines as parallel processes: both involve organizing complexity to uncover patterns, drive resilience, and create progress.

My South Asian roots in Nepal and Bangladesh shape a curiosity about culture and identity. Travel is a way to reconnect with history and perspective.

Fitness is central to my daily life, particularly bodybuilding and hypertrophy training. I approach physical growth as both discipline and narrative — a practice of transformation, structure, and persistence that mirrors the intellectual work of research.

I am also drawn to design and systems thinking, from building datasets and productivity dashboards to experimenting with storytelling through writing and media. These practices let me bridge academic, professional, and creative communities while turning disorder into clarity.
